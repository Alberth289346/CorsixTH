.Global overview of the application

The main blocks here are the *Simulator* that simulates the hospital of the
user, and the *Remote simulators* convert data from the network to simulate the hospitals
of the competitors. All simulations are displayed by the *User interface* (UI)
at the right. Input from the user is sent back.
The *Common* block deals with the shared resources with the competitors. All
these blocks need to perform processing to do their job (marked with a star).

The other blocks contain just data. The *Config* contains the user
configuration, *Graphics* contain all images to display a hospital, while *Game
objects* contain the various properties of the objects and entities, from foot
print to cost to available types of patients and doctor specializations.

Lines with arrows show the connections between the block and the (main) direction
of information stream.
